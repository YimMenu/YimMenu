## How to build

Requirements:

 * [git](#git)
 * [premake5](#premake5)

If you have both of the above requirements you can skip to [cloning the git repo and generating the project files](#cloning-and-generating-project-files).

### Git

If you haven't installed git on your system go and do so it is **REQUIRED** for setting up a working build environment.

[Download Link](https://git-scm.com/download/win)

### Premake5

Premake5 is used to generate our project files, if you haven't used it before we will need to download and add it to our [System Path](https://www.architectryan.com/2018/03/17/add-to-the-path-on-windows-10/).

[Download Link](https://premake.github.io/download/)

### Cloning and generating project files

Clone the repository including submodules:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YimMenu/YimMenu.git --recursive || echo "You don't have git installed, install it from https://git-scm.com/download/win"
```

Go into the directory you just cloned:
```bash
cd YimMenu
```

Generate project files:
```bash
script.bat
```
Now, you will be able to open the solution, and simply build it in Visual Studio.

## Staying Up To Date

Make sure your Visual Studio is closed and regenerate project files:
```bash
script.bat
```

## Project Structure

- `backend/` all features that should be ran in a loop are in here sorted by category
- `gui/` includes everything related to UI elements
- `hooks/` function hooks
- `native_hooks/` hooks to natives
- `services/` service files to interact and maintain stuff
- `util/` general utility functions to keep code as compact and as much in one place as possible

## Features

Below is an incomplete list of feature that I believe are notable to this "base" or menu.

 - Return Native spoofing
 - Custom [settings](BigBaseV2/src/core/globals.hpp) with deep compare if changes were made include auto saving
 - Clear and well structured source code
 - Includes a thread pool to queue tasks that shouldn't block the game thread, very similar to fiber pool
 - Updated natives.hpp from https://nativedb.spyral.dev
 - ReClass.NET structures implemented, accessible from a global called g_local_player defined in `common.hpp`

## Contributing

You're free to contribute to YimMenu as long as the feature are useful, non-toxic and do not contain anything money related that might get the menu targetted by Take2.

Make sure to read the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file.
